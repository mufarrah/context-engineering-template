## Overview

Cross-cutting processes that document HOW things work end-to-end. These show the sequence of steps, decision points, and data flow across multiple components and services. Each flow file describes a multi-step process -- its trigger, steps, entry points, and edge cases.

## Reading Order

After understanding a concept, read the relevant flow to see how it operates in practice. Flows connect concepts to implementations.
