## Overview

Project-specific implementation patterns that document WHERE and HOW code is organized. Each project has its own sub-directory with patterns specific to that codebase and technology stack. Implementation files describe key files, code patterns, anti-patterns, and practical examples.

## Projects

| Project | Tech Stack | Topics |
|---------|------------|--------|

## Reading Order

After understanding concepts and flows, read the implementation for your target project to get project-specific patterns and code examples.

## Topics

| Topic | Summary | Project |
|-------|---------|---------|
| *(none yet -- use `/update-knowledge-base` after completing a PRP, or create topics manually from `_TEMPLATES/implementation-template.md`)* | | |
