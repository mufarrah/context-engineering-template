# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing
specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific
domains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent
equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.

**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.

**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   ├── description: (required)
│   │   └── compatibility: (optional, rarely needed)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

Every SKILL.md consists of:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields (required), plus optional fields like `metadata` and `compatibility`. Only `name` and `description` are read by Claude to determine when the skill triggers, so be clear and comprehensive about what the skill is and when it should be used. The `compatibility` field is for noting environment requirements (target product, system packages, etc.) but most skills don't need it.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both.

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified
- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context

#### What to Not Include in a Skill

A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:

- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- etc.

The skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand.

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)

#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns

Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.

**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details into separate reference files.

**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features

- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
```

**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    └── product.md (API usage, features)
```

**Pattern 3: Conditional details**

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
```

**Important guidelines:**

- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md.
- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top.

## Skill Creation Process

Skill creation involves these steps:

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)
4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)
6. Iterate based on real usage

Follow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. Ask questions like:

- "What functionality should this skill support?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

Analyze each example by:
1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

When creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script:

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

The script creates the skill directory with a SKILL.md template and example resource directories.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

#### Learn Proven Design Patterns

Consult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:

- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic
- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

Begin with the reusable resources identified above. Added scripts must be tested by actually running them.

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.

##### Frontmatter

Write the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

- `name`: The skill name
- `description`: Primary triggering mechanism. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts.

Do not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.

### Step 5: Packaging a Skill

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>
```

The packaging script will validate and then package the skill into a distributable .skill file.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Use the skill on real tasks, notice struggles, and update accordingly.
